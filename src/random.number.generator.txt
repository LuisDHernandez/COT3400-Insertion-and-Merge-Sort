My random generator consisted of the following snippet of code:

  int upperBound = choose_file;
    Random number = new Random();
    ArrayList<Integer> unsorted_keys = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    for (int i = 0; i < choose_file; i++) {
      unsorted_keys.add(number.nextInt(upperBound));

This helped me populate the different input files quickly and effectively. After populating the input files,
 I no longer needed this snippet in my code to execute the algorithms and show the difference in computing time.
